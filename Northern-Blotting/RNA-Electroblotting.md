Protocol:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Part 1: Preparing Agarose gel for electroblotting (~1.5 hours)**  

**1.** Rinse gel 3 times for 10 minutes in (MilliQ) water (dispose of liquid formaldehyde waste). If the gel was destained due to GelRed/GelGreen staining, these washes are unnecessary. <br/> Image gel to ensure even loading before assembling Northern transfer.

**2.** Soak gel in 5 volumes of 0.05 N NaOH for 20 minutes. <br/> _Note: This fragments RNA, allowing RNAs > 2000 nt to transfer better._

**3.** Discard NaOH solution.<br/> Equilibrate gel in 10 volumes of transfer buffer (1X TBE) for 20 minutes. <br/> _Note: This 1X TBE cannot be re-used, as it contains NaOH._


**Part 2: Electroblotting Transfer to nylon membrane (~2 hours)** 

**4.** Cut a nylon membrane as close to the size of your gel as possible. <br/>Equilibrate nylon membrane and 8 sheets of whatman paper in 1X TBE buffer for 10 minutes.

**5.** Rinse 2 sponges with distilled water and shake dry. Assemble transfer sandwich in plastic chamber: <br/> bubble-guard > cathode (-) > bubble-guard > sponge

**6.** Fill the chamber half-way with 1X TBE and continue with sandwich assembly: <br/> 4x whatman > gel > nylon membrane > 4x whatman <br/>
_The two whatmans on each side that are closest to the gel can be cut to closer fit the agarose gel to prevent bubbles_
_Note: Roll out air bubbles twice, once after placing the gel and once after the paper_

**7.** Complete the "sandwich" and ensure a tight fit within the whole apparatus: <br/> sponge > bubble-guard(if it can fit) > anode (+) <br/>
_Note: the gel will shrink as the transfer progress. If the sandwich is not very tight, can add additional sponges._

**8.** Transfer at 12 V for 1.5 hours in 1X TBE running buffer in the cold room.  


**Part 3: Preparation of membrane for Northern blotting (~10 minutes)** 

**9.** Carefully disassemble the transfer. <br/> _Note: you can save the gel for imaging to confirm transfer._ 

**10.** Gently wash blot in 2X SSC buffer for 5 minutes with RNA side up. <br/> _Note: the RNA is associated with the blot, but not attached._

**11.** Set the blot on whatman paper (RNA side up) to wick away excess buffer.  

**12.** Crosslink RNA to blot with 2 exposures of 120 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup> of 254 nm UV. <br/> _The blot can be stored between sheets of whatman paper long term in a dessicator._<br/> _Transfer efficiency can be imaged directly if RNA was stained in-gel (GelRed)._
